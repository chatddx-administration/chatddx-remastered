# Deploy: work in progress

How chatddx is to run outside a development shell: a NixOS module whose systemd services run it on a host, and
containers for a Kubernetes cluster. The NixOS module is built; the containers aren't.
"Decided" means the user said so; "Take" is the agent's recommendation and still open.

## Start with this
1. **Decided: deploy is the last wip.** It can be solidified only once every other wip is resolved, and
   `agents/wip-clearance.md` above all: a deployment is where real patient data first arrives, and what has to hold
   before then is listed there ("Before real patient data").
2. **Decided, built: `chatddx run` and `chatddx portal`.** `chatddx run` is what `chatddx portal` was, the portal,
   the API and a worker in one process, with `--watch`, as the convenience for development. `chatddx portal` now
   serves the portal and the API with no worker, so that the NixOS module's systemd services each run a command of
   their own (see "Services and commands").
3. **Decided: two targets**, a NixOS module (see "The NixOS module") and containers for a Kubernetes cluster (see
   "Containers for Kubernetes"). Which of them serves real patient data first is open.

## What holds now
- **The flake** (`flake.nix`) has `packages.default`, the Python environment with `chatddx` on its PATH, and
  `packages.frontend`, the portal's build, which a deployment points `CHATDDX_PORTAL_ASSETS` at
  (`agents/wip-portal.md`, "Open"); `nixosModules.default`, and its tests in `checks` (see "The NixOS module"). It
  has no image, and nothing builds it but a person: there is no CI.
- **What serves**, by command (`src/chatddx/cli.py`):

  | Command | Serves |
  |---|---|
  | `chatddx run` | the portal at `/` and the API at `/api/`, with a worker on a thread of its process; `--watch` builds the frontend with pnpm as it changes |
  | `chatddx portal` | the portal at `/` and the API at `/api/`, with no worker; `chatddx worker` runs beside it |
  | `chatddx api` | the API at `/api/`, with no worker; `chatddx worker` runs beside it |
  | `chatddx worker` | the queue for a World, until SIGTERM or SIGINT; what it holds then is queued again |
  | `chatddx migrate` | the migrations, as the admin, up to a tier (`docs/modules/store.md`, "Tiers") |
  | `chatddx fake-engines` | the World's fake engines, for development |

- **Stopping a worker**: its scorings go on for `settings.WORKER_DEADLINE` (60 s), which is to be "within the stop
  timeout of the service that runs the worker" (`src/chatddx/settings.py`). systemd's default stop timeout is 90 s;
  Kubernetes' default grace period is 30 s.
- **Several processes may serve one database**: workers take turns to claim (`docs/modules/worker.md`, "Where it runs"), and a
  run's events reach every app through `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` (`src/chatddx/api/listening.py`). Sessions are in the
  database.
- **What a process reads from its environment**: `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_ADMIN`
  (`settings.database`); `HOST`, where to listen; `CHATDDX_WORLD`, `CHATDDX_PORTAL_ASSETS` and `CHATDDX_REVISION`;
  and each endpoint's secret, under the variable its `credential` names (`docs/modules/inventory.md`, "Endpoints"), read in
  `src/chatddx/runner/gate.py` and `src/chatddx/scripted/fakes.py`, not through `chatddx.settings`.
- **The database**: `src/chatddx/store/setup.sql` makes the admin `chatddx`, the writer `chatddx_writer` and the
  database. Development connects on a socket with peer authentication, OS users mapped to roles (AGENTS.md,
  "Environment"). `settings.database` names a host, a user and a database only, so a password or TLS can come only
  from libpq's own `PG*` variables.
- **A World is a directory**: its inventory, its facts, and a directory source's vignettes (`worlds/sample/vignettes`),
  which are sensitive unless declared otherwise (`docs/reference/inventory.md`, `Source`). Every process but `migrate`
  reads one.
- **Where it is to run**, in two places that don't agree yet:
  - `docs/chatddx.md` ("Target stack"): the orchestrator "Runs in Kubernetes, writes the start-ups and hosts the
    portal", and each inference server serves vLLM in a NixOS container;
  - the worker's: decided, the HTTP server, the API and the worker as separate systemd services on NixOS, with the
    module's stop timeout above the worker's deadline, which is the worker's own (`docs/modules/worker.md`, "Stopping"). What
    the HTTP server is was left open: the portal's pages served apart from the API, or a proxy in front of both.
- **Identity**: "The deployment is to sit behind Keycloak" (`docs/modules/identity.md`, "Keycloak"), which isn't decided
  further. Take: a proxy in front, such as oauth2-proxy, passes the login in a header the app believes from it alone,
  mapped onto `person.login`, and Keycloak's own tokens are bearers for scripts when they come. Whether roles then come
  from Keycloak's realm roles instead of the column isn't decided.

## What a deployment runs
- **The app**: one Python process (uvicorn), the portal's pages at `/`, rendered on the server with Jinja2, and the API
  at `/api/`. They are one FastAPI app, not two services: the portal mounts the API (`src/chatddx/portal/app.py:app`),
  calls its route functions, and shares its `__Host-` session cookie and its same-origin check. `chatddx api` serves
  the API alone, without the pages.
- **The frontend's build**: static files, hashed JS and CSS, fonts and Vite's manifest, built by Nix
  (`packages.frontend`). There is no Node at run time: the islands are Svelte compiled for the browser, with no
  server-side rendering, and pnpm and Node only build them (`--watch` runs `vite build --watch`). The app serves them
  at `/static/`, and reads the manifest to name them in its pages, so it needs `CHATDDX_PORTAL_ASSETS` even when a
  proxy serves the files.
- **Workers**: `chatddx worker`, one or more, which send queued runs and score them, judges included.
- **Engines**, which both reach: the worker to send, and the app to confirm an endpoint before it starts a run
  (`src/chatddx/runner/gate.py:admit`, a request with the endpoint's secret). vLLM runs on the inference hosts, outside
  the module; `chatddx fake-engines` could stand in on a demo host.
- **PostgreSQL 16**: the database, the admin and the writer, and `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` for a run's events and for waking
  workers.
- **Migrations**: `chatddx migrate`, once, as the admin, before the app and the workers start.
- **The World**: a directory both read, with sensitive vignettes in it.
- **Secrets**: the endpoints' credentials, which both the app and the workers need, and the database's, beyond peer
  authentication.
- **In front**: TLS and a reverse proxy, and later Keycloak.
- **The operator's commands**, not services: `chatddx person add` and `password`, `init-data`, `import-engine` and
  `repl`, with the same World and database as the services.
- **Something on a schedule**, once there is a command for it: purging expired sessions (`agents/wip-clearance.md`,
  "Before real patient data", Sessions).

## Services and commands
Decided, built: each service runs one command, with no flag that changes what it serves. `chatddx portal` serves the
app without a worker (`src/chatddx/cli.py:_portal`), as `chatddx api` serves the API.

| Service | Command |
|---|---|
| the app, the portal with the API | `chatddx portal` |
| the API alone, where nothing serves the portal | `chatddx api` |
| each worker | `chatddx worker` |
| the migrations, before the others start | `chatddx migrate` |

Take: "the HTTP server" of the worker's decision is the proxy in front of the app, since the portal and
the API are one app on one origin.

## The NixOS module
Built: `nix/module.nix`, the flake's `nixosModules.default`, as `services.chatddx`. Decided: the module closes over
this flake (`lib.modules.importApply`), whose packages and revision are its defaults, so that it needs no
`specialArgs`, and a system that has the flake under another name (Kompismoln's `chatddx-dev`) gets that flake's.
`nix/test.nix`, the flake's `checks.<system>.module`, boots it in a VM.
- **Options**: `package` and `frontend`, the flake's; `revision`, the flake's, as `CHATDDX_REVISION`; `admin`;
  `world`; `facts`; `listen`; `workers`; `environmentFile`; `database` (`createLocally`, `host`, `name`, `tier`); and
  `nginx` (`enable`, `hostName`, `signInRate`).
- **Services**, under `chatddx.target` (see "Services and commands"):
  - `chatddx-migrate`, a oneshot as the admin, after `postgresql.target`. The others require it, so a switch that
    changes it restarts them after it;
  - `chatddx-portal`, `chatddx portal` as the writer;
  - `chatddx-worker-1` and on, `chatddx worker` as the writer, with `TimeoutStopSec` at 90 s, above
    `WORKER_DEADLINE`.
- **Users**: the system users `admin`, `chatddx` unless the host names another, and `chatddx_writer`, named as the
  roles, so that NixOS' default `local all all peer` needs no map. The module declares the admin a system user in a
  group of its name, which merges with the host's own declaration of the same user, with its id and home (Kompismoln's
  principal, see "On Kompismoln").
- **The database**, with `createLocally`, the default: `services.postgresql`, the database owned by the admin
  (`ensureDBOwnership`, so it is named as the admin), the admin with `createrole` for tier 1's reader, and the writer.
  Without `createdb`, which only the tests use. The module leaves PostgreSQL's version to the host, whose cluster is
  tied to its own, and warns when it is neither 16 nor 17. Decided: 17 is accepted, as Kompismoln's hosts serve it
  (o11n's `nixos/postgresql.nix`).
- **The operator's `chatddx`**, on the system's PATH: the services' environment, and the secrets when it can read
  them; run as root, it runs as the writer, or as the admin for `migrate`.
- **Secrets**: `environmentFile`, read by systemd for the portal and the workers. A path in the store is refused
  (`types.externalPath`).
- **The World**: a path in the store is refused too, as the store is readable by every user of the host. The services
  can't see /home (`ProtectHome`).
- **nginx**, with `nginx.enable`:
  - HTTPS, from ACME unless the host gives a certificate, and everything proxied to the app, `/static/` included;
  - HSTS, `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: same-origin` and `frame-ancestors 'none'`;
  - sign-ins (`POST /sign-in`, `POST /api/session`) limited per address to `signInRate`, 10 a minute, with a burst of
    5, and 429 beyond;
  - nginx's default limit on a request's body, 1 MB;
  - a run's event stream unbuffered, as the API asks with `X-Accel-Buffering: no`.
- **Hardening**: every service sandboxed (`ProtectSystem=strict`, `ProtectHome`, `PrivateTmp`, `PrivateDevices`, no
  capabilities, `@system-service` system calls, `UMask=0077` and the like), and `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and
  `all_proxy`, in either case, unset for them even when the host sets them for every service.
- **The test**: PostgreSQL 17; the admin a user of the test's own, `chatddx-test`, with a home (0750), as an org
  declares it; the sample World copied out of the store into that home, reached through the admin's group, which the
  writer is in; the portal on `[::1]:8000`; and the World's secret in a file. That the migrations run as the admin,
  and that the writer reads the World and `nobody` doesn't; through the operator's command, init-data and a password;
  then the fake engines. Through nginx, with a certificate made for the test: a typed case run by the portal, sent and
  scored by a worker; the headers; a 429 among sign-ins sent at once. Last, a worker that doesn't see a proxy set for
  every service. It passed by emulation in a cloud session before the admin option; decided since, a cloud session
  doesn't run it, the person does, on a host with KVM (`docs/nixos-test-procedure.md`, "Who runs what").
- **The evaluation**: `nix/module-eval.nix`, the flake's `checks.<system>.module-eval`, evaluates the module without
  building or booting: the default and an org's admin, workers, a database elsewhere, ordering, the sandbox's settings,
  PostgreSQL's versions, the database's name, and paths in the store refused. A cloud session runs it, `pytest` against
  PostgreSQL 17 and the host flow (`docs/nixos-test-procedure.md`).
- Open:
  - static files from nginx rather than the app, left with caching the build (`agents/wip-portal.md`, "Open");
  - a `script-src` and `/api/docs` (`agents/wip-clearance.md`, "Before real patient data", Headers);
  - a timer that purges expired sessions, once there is a command for it;
  - whether the module also serves an inference host's vLLM from an endpoint's start-up, as `fake-engines` serves a
    fake from it, or that stays with the hosts' own NixOS containers (`docs/chatddx.md`, "Target stack").

## On Kompismoln
Decided: chatddx-dev first, on stationary, from this repository's `main`, with the World `worlds/kompismoln`; the old
chatddx stays on helsinki meanwhile.
- **Where it is**: Kompismoln's org (`Kompismoln/org`), in `apps/chatddx-remastered.nix`, the app file of
  `[app.chatddx-dev]` in its `org.toml`, which o11n's app-scheduler role imports on the app's hosts. It adapts the
  org's app to `services.chatddx`; o11n has nothing of chatddx's.
- **What the org gives**: the app's principal, `chatddx-dev`, a system user with an id, a home in
  `/var/lib/chatddx-dev` that stationary keeps across its ephemeral root, and a loopback address of its own
  (`bindAddress`). Decided: the principal is the admin (`admin`, and the database of its name). The writer is in its
  group (`principal.members`), to read the World in its home.
- **What the app file adds**: `listen` on the principal's address; nginx for the app's endpoint; o11n's
  `nixos/nginx.nix` (ACME, the firewall) and `nixos/postgresql.nix` (PostgreSQL 17, its directory kept across the
  ephemeral root, a daily dump into the home); and `chatddx-worlds`, a oneshot before `chatddx-migrate` that copies the
  repository's `worlds/` into the home, since `worlds/kompismoln` refers to the sample's vignettes and `_data`.
- **One chatddx to a database server**: the migrations name the writer's and the reader's roles, which are the
  server's, not the database's. chatddx and chatddx-dev are on different hosts.
- Open: helsinki's chatddx, once chatddx-dev has replaced it: the app file becomes `apps/chatddx.nix`, the org's
  `chatddx` input this repository, and o11n's `nixos/django.nix` is left with no user.

## Containers for Kubernetes
- **The image**: Take: built by Nix (`dockerTools.streamLayeredImage`) from `packages.default` and
  `packages.frontend`, so that it holds the flake's closure and nothing else, with `CHATDDX_REVISION` set from the
  flake's revision. One image; each workload names its command (see "Services and commands").
- **Workloads**:
  - a Deployment for `chatddx portal`, with a Service and an Ingress, the event stream unbuffered there too;
  - a Deployment for `chatddx worker`, with `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` above `WORKER_DEADLINE`, since the
    default is shorter;
  - a Job for `chatddx migrate` before each release, as the admin.
- **The database**: peer authentication doesn't reach across pods, so the roles sign in with a password or a
  certificate over TCP. `settings.database` passes neither (see "What holds now"). Take: `chatddx.settings` names what
  libpq takes (`PGPASSFILE`, `PGSSLMODE` and the like), as the project's source of truth, rather than leaving it to
  libpq's environment. In the cluster (an operator such as CloudNativePG) or outside it is open.
- **Connections**: replicas multiply what each process holds, with no pool (`agents/wip-clearance.md`, "Before real
  patient data", Connections), against Postgres' `max_connections`.
- **The World**: not in the image, which a registry holds. Take: the inventory and facts as a ConfigMap; a directory
  source's vignettes on a volume only the workloads mount; endpoint secrets as a Secret, under the names the
  inventory gives.
- **Egress**: Take: a NetworkPolicy that lets the pods reach Postgres and the inventory's endpoints only, so that the
  network holds what the gate holds (`agents/wip-clearance.md`, "Vetted endpoints").
- **Probes**: the app has no health route, and the worker no HTTP at all. The app answers HEAD with 405, as FastAPI
  adds no HEAD to a GET route, so a probe has to GET. Open: a route for readiness, and whether the worker's beats
  (`settings.WORKER_BEAT`) can serve as its liveness.
- **Reaching the inference hosts**: pelle and malborg are on Kompismoln's VPN (README, "Kompismoln's hosts"). Open:
  how the cluster's pods reach them.
- Open: where the manifests live and what writes them (plain YAML in the repository, Helm, or Nix).

## Open
- Which target serves real patient data first, and whether the other stays (`docs/chatddx.md` puts the orchestrator
  in Kubernetes; `docs/modules/worker.md` decides systemd on NixOS).
- Keycloak in front (`docs/modules/identity.md`, "Keycloak"; `agents/wip-portal.md`, "Open"): which target runs it, and how it
  hands the app a login.
- CI: what builds the image and the module's test, and runs `pytest` and the frontend's checks, before a deployment
  takes a revision. The VM test needs KVM: a self-hosted runner on one of Kompismoln's hosts is among the options in
  o11n's `agents/wip-self-hosted-kvm.md`.
